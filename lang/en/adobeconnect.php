<p>
If you are creating a private meeting it is always good practice to assign at
least 1 host or presenter who will be present in the meeting; because users with
the participant role will be unable to join the meeting unless a user with the
host or presenter roles has already joined th meeting.
</p>

<p>
If the meeting has support for separate groups at least 1 user in each group, who is
to be present in the meeting, should have either the host or presenter role.

 when customizing the URL to <b>mymeeting</b>, the URL to connect to the meeting would be <b>http://adobe.connect.server/mymeeting</b>. Leave out the trailing forward slash
